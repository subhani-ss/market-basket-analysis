## üß† Ever walked into a store for just one thing and somehow walked out with five?

Maybe it was a chocolate bar perfectly placed next to the checkout, or a kitchen gadget you didn‚Äôt know you needed until you saw it paired with the blender you were buying...

These aren‚Äôt random events. They‚Äôre the result of a smart, behind-the-scenes data strategy called **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)** ‚Äî a technique retailers use to uncover the secret connections between what we buy and why we buy it.

## üìö What is Market Basket Analysis?

When customers buy bread, they often end up buying butter too. This buying pattern can be described with a simple rule:

> IF `{bread}` THEN `{butter}`

In simple terms, **MBA is a data mining technique** used to identify patterns in customer purchasing behaviour ‚Äî helping businesses group products that are frequently bought together. This insight is used in everything from **recommendation engines** and **product bundling**, to **store layout design** and **marketing strategies**.

## üîç Association Rule Mining with Apriori

MBA uses association rules ‚Äî logic-based rules that identify relationships between items. The **Apriori algorithm** is one of the most popular ways to generate these rules.

### üßÆ Key Metrics:

- **Support**: Frequency of items appearing together  
- **Confidence**: Likelihood of item B being bought when item A is bought  
- **Lift**: How much more likely items are bought together compared to being bought independently

For example:  
> IF `{coffee}` THEN `{sugar}`  
> Support = 0.05, Confidence = 0.6, Lift = 2.0

This means that 5% of all transactions include both, 60% of people who buy coffee also buy sugar, and they are 2x more likely to be bought together than by chance.
