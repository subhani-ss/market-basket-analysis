# üõí Uncovering Shopping Patterns: Market Basket Analysis Using the Apriori Algorithm


## üß† Ever walked into a store for just one thing and somehow walked out with five?

Maybe it was a chocolate bar perfectly placed next to the checkout, or a kitchen gadget you didn‚Äôt know you needed until you saw it paired with the blender you were buying...

These aren‚Äôt random events. They‚Äôre the result of a smart, behind-the-scenes data strategy called **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)** ‚Äî a technique retailers use to uncover the secret connections between what we buy and why we buy it.


## üìö What is Market Basket Analysis?

When customers buy bread, they often end up buying butter too. This buying pattern can be described with a simple rule:

> IF `{bread}` THEN `{butter}`

In simple terms, **MBA is a data mining technique** used to identify patterns in customer purchasing behaviour ‚Äî helping businesses group products that are frequently bought together. This insight is used in everything from **recommendation engines** and **product bundling**, to **store layout design** and **marketing strategies**.


## üîç Association Rule Mining with Apriori

MBA uses association rules ‚Äî logic-based rules that identify relationships between items. The **Apriori algorithm** is one of the most popular ways to generate these rules.

### üßÆ Key Metrics:

- **Support**: Frequency of items appearing together  
- **Confidence**: Likelihood of item B being bought when item A is bought  
- **Lift**: How much more likely items are bought together compared to being bought independently

For example:  
> IF `{coffee}` THEN `{sugar}`  
> Support = 0.05, Confidence = 0.6, Lift = 2.0

This means that 5% of all transactions include both, 60% of people who buy coffee also buy sugar, and they are 2x more likely to be bought together than by chance.



## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Using Python

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to apply MBA using the **Apriori algorithm** in Python:



### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

```python
!pip install apyori
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import Counter
from apyori import apriori
```

### Step 2: Load Dataset
```python
df = pd.read_csv("dailytransactions.csv")
```

### Step 3: Prepare the Transactions List

```python
transactions = []
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    transaction = [str(item).strip() for item in row if pd.notna(item)]
    if transaction:
        transactions.append(transaction)
```

### Step 4: Apply Apriori Algorithm

```python
results = apriori(transactions, min_support=0.01, min_confidence=0.5, min_lift=1.2))
```

### Step 5: Extract and Format Rules

```python
rule_data = []
for rule in results:
    for stat in rule.ordered_statistics:
        if stat.items_base and stat.items_add:
            rule_data.append({
                'LHS (If bought)': ', '.join(stat.items_base),
                'RHS (Then also bought)': ', '.join(stat.items_add),
                'Support': round(rule.support, 4),
                'Confidence': round(stat.confidence, 2),
                'Lift': round(stat.lift, 2)
            })

df_rules = pd.DataFrame(rule_data)
```


### Step 6: Display Top 10 Rules

```python
top_10_rules = df_rules.sort_values(by='Lift', ascending=False).head(10)
print(top_10_rules.to_string(index=False))
```


### Step 7: Visualize the Rules

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.barh(
    [f"{row['LHS (If bought)']} ‚Üí {row['RHS (Then also bought)']}" for _, row in top_10_rules.iterrows()],
    top_10_rules['Lift'],
    color='coral'
)
plt.xlabel("Lift")
plt.title("Top 10 Association Rules by Lift")
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Summary

This practical walkthrough demonstrates how Apriori helps uncover hidden patterns in customer purchases. Retailers can use these rules to:

Recommend items (e.g., ‚ÄúCustomers who bought bread also bought butter‚Äù)
Bundle products for promotions
Organize shelves for convenience and sales optimization
Market Basket Analysis, powered by algorithms like Apriori, transforms raw transaction data into strategic insights ‚Äî ultimately enhancing the shopping experience and driving revenue growth.
